# GAHSUS

## What is GAHSUS?
GAHSUS is a passion project meant to be the most advanced free and publically available universe simulator. Using procedural generation, gpu acceleration, and a bunch of other stuff I barely understand to make it as good as possible.
## How?
In rust, if you want more info then your probably capable enough to look through the source code
## When will the next release/update be?
Idk, tommorow, next year, on my death bed, its uncertain
